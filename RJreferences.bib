  abstract  = "Many statistical procedures assume that the underlying
               data-generating process involves Gaussian errors. Among the
               popular tests for normality, only the Kolmogorov?Smirnov test
               has a graphical representation. Alternative tests, such as the
               Shapiro?Wilk test, offer little insight as to how the observed
               data deviate from normality. In this article, we discuss a
               simple new graphical procedure which provides simultaneous
               confidence bands for a normal quantile?quantile plot. These
               bands define a test of normality and are narrower in the tails
               than those related to the Kolmogorov?Smirnov test.
               Correspondingly, the new procedure has greater power to detect
               deviations from normality in the tails. Supplementary materials
               for this article are available online.",

  abstract  = "AbstractIn statistical modeling, we strive to specify models
               that resemble data collected in studies or observed from
               processes. Consequently, distributional specification and
               parameter estimation are central to parametric models. Graphical
               procedures, such as the quantile?quantile (Q?Q) plot, are
               arguably the most widely used method of distributional
               assessment, though critics find their interpretation to be
               overly subjective. Formal goodness of fit tests are available
               and are quite powerful, but only indicate whether there is a
               lack of fit, not why there is lack of fit. In this article, we
               explore the use of the lineup protocol to inject rigor into
               graphical distributional assessment and compare its power to
               that of formal distributional tests. We find that lineup tests
               are considerably more powerful than traditional tests of
               normality. A further investigation into the design of Q?Q plots
               shows that de-trended Q?Q plots are more powerful than the
               standard approach as long as the plot preserves distances in x
               and y to be the same. While we focus on diagnosing nonnormality,
               our approach is general and can be directly extended to the
               assessment of other distributions.",
