               has a graphical representation. Alternative tests, such as the
               Shapiro?Wilk test, offer little insight as to how the observed
               data deviate from normality. In this article, we discuss a
               simple new graphical procedure which provides simultaneous
               confidence bands for a normal quantile?quantile plot. These
               bands define a test of normality and are narrower in the tails
               than those related to the Kolmogorov?Smirnov test.
               Correspondingly, the new procedure has greater power to detect
               deviations from normality in the tails. Supplementary materials

  abstract  = "AbstractIn statistical modeling, we strive to specify models
               that resemble data collected in studies or observed from
               processes. Consequently, distributional specification and
               parameter estimation are central to parametric models. Graphical
               procedures, such as the quantile?quantile (Q?Q) plot, are
               arguably the most widely used method of distributional
               assessment, though critics find their interpretation to be
               overly subjective. Formal goodness of fit tests are available
               and are quite powerful, but only indicate whether there is a
               lack of fit, not why there is lack of fit. In this article, we
               explore the use of the lineup protocol to inject rigor into
               graphical distributional assessment and compare its power to
               that of formal distributional tests. We find that lineup tests
               are considerably more powerful than traditional tests of
               normality. A further investigation into the design of Q?Q plots
               shows that de-trended Q?Q plots are more powerful than the
               standard approach as long as the plot preserves distances in x
               and y to be the same. While we focus on diagnosing nonnormality,
               our approach is general and can be directly extended to the
               assessment of other distributions.",

@ARTICLE{Rousseeuw1993-zd,
  title     = "Alternatives to the Median Absolute Deviation",
  author    = "Rousseeuw, Peter J and Croux, Christophe",
  abstract  = "Abstract In robust estimation one frequently needs an initial or
               auxiliary estimate of scale. For this one usually takes the
               median absolute deviation MAD n = 1.4826 med, \{|xi ? med j x j
               |\}, because it has a simple explicit formula, needs little
               computation time, and is very robust as witnessed by its bounded
               influence function and its 50\% breakdown point. But there is
               still room for improvement in two areas: the fact that MAD n is
               aimed at symmetric distributions and its low (37\%) Gaussian
               efficiency. In this article we set out to construct explicit and
               50\% breakdown scale estimators that are more efficient. We
               consider the estimator Sn = 1.1926 med, \{med j | xi ? xj |\}
               and the estimator Qn given by the .25 quantile of the distances
               \{|xi ? x j |; i < j\}. Note that Sn and Qn do not need any
               location estimate. Both Sn and Qn can be computed using O(n log
               n) time and O(n) storage. The Gaussian efficiency of Sn is 58\%,
               whereas Qn attains 82\%. We study Sn and Qn by means of their
               influence functions, their bias curves (for implosion as well as
               explosion), and their finite-sample performance. Their behavior
               is also compared at non-Gaussian models, including the negative
               exponential model where Sn has a lower gross-error sensitivity
               than the MAD.",
